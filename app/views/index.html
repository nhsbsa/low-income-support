                            willing to 'give it a go' on the off chance that they receive help. Paper applications
                            typically have more barriers to face before applying e.g. Purchasing a stamp, posting the

                        <p>During our mini discovery on how to reduce the amount of time from 'Awareness to outcome' for
                            applicants, we discovered that the Assessment team are increasingly spending more time
                            assessing applications where the user is quite clearly not going to receive any help with
                            their health costs due to the amount of income they receive.<p>
                                <p>Our initial theory is that this is because applying online has become so easy, that
                                    applicants are willing to 'give it a go' on the off chance that they receive help.
                                    Paper applications typically have more barriers to face before applying e.g.
                                    Purchasing a stamp, posting the application etc...</p>
                                <p>It's important that we balance the ease of applying vs. the impact on Operations.</p>
                                <p>Our itention is to make it even clearer that this is a 'low income' scheme to try and
                                    stop wasting applicants (and assessors) time.</p>

                        <p>During our work to reassure applicants that we have received their application, as well as
                            reduce the number of multiple applications, we want to limit the number of email bounces
                            received by getting applicants to check their email address after they have entered it.<p>
                                <p>Speaking to the assessment team, email bounces are a common occurance and are
                                    therefore a source of delay to applicants receiving help with their health costs.

                                <p>One reason this happens for postal applicants is the assessment team not
                                    understanding the applicants handwriting.</p>

                            decrease the number of times assessors need to contact applicants for further information by
                            XX% and therefore increase the speed from awareness to outcome.</p>
                        <p>During our regular Assessor Feedback sessions, it was highlighted that Assessors were seeing
                            a number of applicants say they received a state benefit, but when asked which one - they
                            didn't select one from our list which which meant that they had to go back to clarify.<p>
                                <p>During research (PrB 60_2) we saw this first hand when during an initital
                                    conversation, the user told us they received 'ESA' but despite this option being
                                    available to them - they didn't select it.</p>
                                <p>We believe that this is because each person sees what type of benefit they are on
                                    very differently e.g. They saw 'ESA' as 'Sick Pay', whereas the section title said
                                    'Disability, illness and carer benefits'. </p>

                        <p>During additional research, when asking what benefit each person was on - the majority of

                        <p>We believe that by putting the acronym at the beginning instead of the end, will allow users
                            who are quickly scanning down the list to successfully choose what benefit they receive
                            instead of potentially missing it.</p>

                            <li>Before a user can successfully save an application, they are asked to enter and verify

                                entered the correct details). As well as this they are asked to enter a memorable word.
                                As of 12th March 2019 only 25 users out of 4051 applications couldn't provide either an

                                the application, as well as their memorable word. Alpha research showed that pensioners
                                didn't like jumping between different methods e.g. Computer > Mobile, so providing email
