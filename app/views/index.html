                            <li>The 'Accessible Autocomplete' component already has a <a href="https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2018/05/15/what-we-learned-from-getting-our-autocomplete-tested-for-accessibility/" target="_blank">wealth of research with people who have access needs</a> - however are there any additional findings when adopting it within our service.</li>
                            <li>Based on the principle of 'Do the hard work to make it simple' - if we have an idea what the user means, we can suggest an answer. So we discussed with assessors how the type of benefit someone receives is referenced. We can then use these findings to come up with a list of 'aliases' to improve how successful people are when trying to find their benefit using the autocomplete component. We plan to validate these findings with users.</li>
                            <li>Because the benefit system in general is a confusing space - assessors often find users putting in 'standard rates' which actually relate to a different similair benefit. The assessor then pends the case and goes back to clarify if they are certain they have selected the right benefit. We can catch these cases before they get to an assessor and say if they're not certain, to check with the Jobcentre Plus Helpline.</li>

                        <p>It takes time, effort and cost (on paper route) for users to send us evidence of their
                            income. It also takes time and effort for assessors to decipher payslips in order to
                            calculate weekly income, leading to an increased wait for the user to receive help.<p>
                                <p>We believe that by capturing this information from applicants directly, we will not
                                    only speed up outcomes, but reduce the overall cost of operations as well.</p>

                        <p>During our mini discovery on how to reduce the amount of time from 'Awareness to outcome' for
                            applicants, we discovered that the Assessment team are increasingly spending more time
                            assessing applications where the user is quite clearly not going to receive any help with
                            their health costs due to the amount of income they receive.<p>
                                <p>Our initial theory is that this is because applying online has become so easy, that
                                    applicants are willing to 'give it a go' on the off chance that they receive help.
                                    Paper applications typically have more barriers to face before applying e.g.
                                    Purchasing a stamp, posting the application etc...</p>
                                <p>It's important that we balance the ease of applying vs. the impact on Operations.</p>
                                <p>Our itention is to make it even clearer that this is a 'low income' scheme to try and
                                    stop wasting applicants (and assessors) time.</p>

                                <p>Speaking to the assessment team, email bounces are a common occurance and are
                                    therefore a source of delay to applicants receiving help with their health costs.

                                <p>One reason this happens for postal applicants is the assessment team not

                            decrease the number of times assessors need to contact applicants for further information by
                            XX% and therefore increase the speed from awareness to outcome.</p>
                        <p>During our regular Assessor Feedback sessions, it was highlighted that Assessors were seeing
                            a number of applicants say they received a state benefit, but when asked which one - they
                            didn't select one from our list which which meant that they had to go back to clarify.<p>
                                <p>During research (PrB 60_2) we saw this first hand when during an initital
                                    conversation, the user told us they received 'ESA' but despite this option being
                                    available to them - they didn't select it.</p>
                                <p>We believe that this is because each person sees what type of benefit they are on
                                    very differently e.g. They saw 'ESA' as 'Sick Pay', whereas the section title said
                                    'Disability, illness and carer benefits'. </p>

                        <p>During additional research, when asking what benefit each person was on - the majority of
                            people responded with the relevant acronym e.g. ESA, rather than it's full name e.g.

                        <p>We believe that by putting the acronym at the beginning instead of the end, will allow users

                            know or can get access to quickly. <strong style="font-weight: bold;">This will</strong>

                        <p>During our regular Assessor Feedback sessions, it was highlighted that Assessors were having
                            to go back a number of times to clarify Council Tax figures from applicants.<p>
                                <p>During research (PrB 60_2) we saw this first hand with a user who immediately entered
                                    their monthly council tax figure, despite the question asking for how much they pay
                                    in total a year.</p>
                                <p>We believe this is because the monthly figure is a lot more accessible to them e.g.
                                    via online banking etc..., to get a yearly amount they either have to dig out the
                                    single letter they receive at the beginning of the year (if they've still kept it!)
                                    or attempt some maths in their head.</p>

                                didn't like jumping between different methods e.g. Computer > Mobile, so providing email

                                and return later, they wanted to save their application and continue. Because of this,
                                once saved, the applicant can also choose to continue as well.</li>
